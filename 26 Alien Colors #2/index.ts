// Choose a color for an alien as you did in Exercise 25, and write an if-else chain.

let aliencolour:string="Green"

// • If the alien’s color is green, print a statement that the player just earned 5 points for shooting the alien.

if(aliencolour == "Green"){
    console.log("congratulation u earn 5 points")
}

// • If the alien’s color isn’t green, print a statement that the player just earned 10 points.

if(aliencolour !== " blue"){
    console.log("Congratulation! u earned 10 point")
}

// • Write one version of this program that runs the if block and another that runs the else block


if(aliencolour="blue"){
    console.log("Congratulations u just earned 5 points")
}else{
    console.log("Congrtaulations u just earned 10 points")
}

//in if else my output is 10 points bcs colour is not match to alien colour
